## New Zealand Atlanta Association App - 2017

Making the NZAA Website sort of greater again... and documenting as I go with feedback from real fellow Americans and Kiwis in this fine city.

[The Trello for this project is at this link and I intend to properly Kanban my progress](https://trello.com/b/RTwTGDnO/nzaa-development)

#### Background:
1. [The current/potentially soon historic website at www.atlantanz.org](www.atlantanz.org). A repo of assets from this page is at https://github.com/airbr/NZAA-historic
2. My early Express/Node Project to make a web app: https://github.com/airbr/nzaa-dev
