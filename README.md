## New Zealand Atlanta Association App - 2017

Making the NZAA Website sort of greater again... and documenting as I go with feedback from real fellow Americans and Kiwis in this fine city.

[The Trello for this project is at this link and I intend to properly Kanban my progress](https://trello.com/b/RTwTGDnO/nzaa-development)

#### Background:
1. Current/Historic Website at atlantanz.org; Repo of assets at https://github.com/airbr/NZAA-historic
2. Early Express/Node Project: https://github.com/airbr/nzaa-dev
